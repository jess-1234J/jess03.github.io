        <p>Eyelash extensions - are becoming a popular trend as everyday women are using them to dramatically enhance their look.<br>
        Technically, eyelash extensions are the process of isolating a single hair of eyelashes and applying an extension to that individual hair.  They are applied to the hair, not touching the skin at all.  The extension stays on the eyelash until that lash naturally sheds.  When done correctly, they should not damage the lashes at all.  Eyelash extensions can give your lashes a full, long, dark, curled look with absolutely no mascara!</p>
        <br><p>What are eyelash extensions?<br><br>
        Eyelash extensions are an exciting new way to extend the length and thickness of your lashes. They are meticulously applied, on a hair-by-hair basis, to your own eyelashes for a completely natural look. Extensions effortlessly allow you to wake up looking refreshed and ready to go and are perfect for summer vacations, when you may want to wear little to no makeup.</p>
        <br><p>Will eyelash extensions damage my natural lash?<br><br>
        When correctly applied by a professional, eyelash extensions will not damage your natural lash. Extensions must be placed individually and separated properly in order for your natural lashes to grow normally. Many make the mistake of “stacking,” which causes damage by pulling your lashes out in clusters or by weighing them down and causing irritation. For these reasons, it is imperative that eyelash extensions are applied by a licensed professional who has adequate experience with this procedure. Also, it is important that you do not rub, pull or pluck out any extensions yourself—let them fall out naturally. However, if you do decide you would like them taken off sooner, our licensed aesthetician will remove the lashes with professional eyelash extension adhesive remover.</p>
        <br><p>How long do they last?<br><br>
        The initial set of lashes lasts up to two months but we recommend coming in two to three weeks after the original set is applied in order to replace any lashes that may have fallen out. The amount of time that your eyelash extensions will last primarily depends on two things – how well you follow the aftercare instructions and your natural, eyelash growth cycle.<br><br>
        Is eyelash extension glue safe for my eyes?<br><br>
        Yes, absolutely! Eyelash extension glue is completely safe and painless. The adhesive used during the service is medically graded and formaldehyde-free. When lashes are applied correctly, the glue and extensions never come in contact with the skin but with your natural hair only, which generally will not cause a reaction or irritation.
        <br>How long is the process?<br><br>
        To apply a full set of lashes, it generally takes at least one and a half hours, depending on the fullness and the set you choose. Additionally, periodic fills take no more than an hour if you come in every two to three weeks.
       <br>What can I do to prepare for this procedure?<br><br>
       It is best to arrive with no makeup on. A clean base is necessary for the adhesive to function properly. Also, if you wear contact lenses, it is best to take them out beforehand, in order to avoid dryness.
       <br>Who would not be a good candidate for this procedure?<br><br>
       You should not get eyelash extensions if you rub your eyes frequently, have highly sensitive skin, extreme allergies, watery eyes, very curly or thin fragile lashes, or no lashes at all.
       <br>Can I wear mascara?<br><br>
       We do not recommend that you wear mascara since most of them are oil-based, which causes the adhesive to break up sooner. Also, waterproof mascara is very difficult to remove and will cause the extensions to clump together.
